# About the Socially Responsible Computing Handbook 

The [Socially Responsible Computing (SRC)](https://responsible.cs.brown.edu/) program in the Computer Science department and the [Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination and Redesign (CNTR)](https://cntr.brown.edu/) in the Data Science Institute are working together to build a [curriculum handbook](https://cntr.brown.edu/projects#socially-responsible-computing-src-curriculum-handbook) that gathers and synthesizes interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder content on social-technical computing topics in automated decision-making, generative AI, privacy and data protection, accessibility, and other areas. This resource will initially be used as a pedagogical tool within the Computer Science department for teaching assistants, faculty, and students, but has the potential to grow into a sustainable, public resource for the Brown community and beyond. The handbook contains a series of primers providing concise yet comprehensive overviews of socially responsible computing learning objectives and curated lists of interdisciplinary, up-to-date, and high quality resources and case studies for further exploration.
