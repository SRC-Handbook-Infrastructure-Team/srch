# About the Socially Responsible Computing Handbook 

The [Socially Responsible Computing (SRC)](https://responsible.cs.brown.edu/) program in the Computer Science department and the [Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination and Redesign (CNTR)](https://cntr.brown.edu/) in the Data Science Institute are working together to build a [curriculum handbook](https://cntr.brown.edu/projects#socially-responsible-computing-src-curriculum-handbook) that gathers and synthesizes interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder content on social-technical computing topics in automated decision-making, generative AI, privacy and data protection, accessibility, and other areas. This resource will initially be used as a pedagogical tool within the Computer Science department for teaching assistants, faculty, and students, but has the potential to grow into a sustainable, public resource for the Brown community and beyond. The handbook contains a series of primers providing concise overviews of socially responsible computing learning objectives and curated lists of interdisciplinary, up-to-date, and high quality resources and case studies for further exploration. The SRC Handbook was founded in May 2024 by Michelle L. Ding '25, Julia Netter, and Suresh Venkatasubramanian and has since expanded into a team of 22 undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. students working on product design, product development, and AI, privacy, and accessibility research. The handbook is a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and community-owned project. Many of our team members are past or former Socially Responsible Computing Teaching Assistants (STAs), the intended users of this resource. Team members come from a diverse set of concentrations, including Behavioral Decision Sciences, Economics, International and Public Affairs, Science Technology and Society, Public Health, Reliigious Studies, Urban Studies, Computational Biology, Data Science, Computer Science, and English. All students working on the handbook are compensated through an independent study credit or pay. The handbook has received funding from the Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) and Google Research.

## How to Use the Handbook
The SRC Handbook is divided into four sections: Privacy, Accessibility, Automated Decision Making, and Generative AI. Each section contains a series of primers that are loosely aligned with learning objectives in the SRC curriculum. Each primer contains a **main body** that provides a concise overview of the learning objective and a series of **side panels** that expand upon definitions, case studies, and additional information. Primers are not meant to be comprehensive. Rather, they are meant to capture an informative picture of the current landscape of multi-stakeholder theory and practice. This is an ongoing project, so many primers are tagged _beta_ to represent a "work in progress" status.
