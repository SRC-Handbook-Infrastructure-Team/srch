## Case Study: WCAG 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Pre-recorded)

“A transcript is provided for audio-only content and a transcript or audio description is provided for video-only content.”[^1]

While this feature undoubtedly aids users with visual or hearing impairment, it also has the ability to benefit every user. Consider being in a library, and needing to listen to an audio clip for class. If you did not have headphones available, or the internet connection was making the video lag, you would be able to use the transcript instead.

## Case Study: High Contrast Screen Settings

The option to change one’s screen to high contrast is available on many of the most common operating systems—i.e. Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Students themselves use this feature since it is a default when they work on IDEs such as VSCode. While we may not think of high contrast as an explicit accessibility feature, it is built to make character distinction easier and less visually taxing than standard white or light screens with dark text.
