## Case Study: Hackathons[^4]

Hackathons hosted by organizations where the prompt is a well-intentioned call to create some technology meant to aid disabled people can be more harmful than helpful. These events often frame the users of this technology as fixed and separate from those designing the technology. Further, by framing the invention of assistive technology (or otherwise) in the brief span of a Hackathon, these events hide the extended, exhaustive process that goes into creating technology by and for disabled people.
