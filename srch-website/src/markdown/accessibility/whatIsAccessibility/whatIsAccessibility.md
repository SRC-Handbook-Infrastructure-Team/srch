# What Is Accessibility?

This primer introduces the concept of accessibility in digital technologies and explains why it matters for all users.

## Introduction

Digital accessibility ensures that technologies can be used by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. This includes individuals with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities, as well as those with temporary or situational limitations.

## Core Principles of Accessibility

### Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. [drawer:Perceivability Examples](perceivability)

### Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable by users with different abilities.

### Understandable

Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable to all users.

### Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## The Curb-Cut Effect

Accessibility features often benefit all users, not just those with disabilities - similar to how curb cuts designed for wheelchair users also help parents with strollers, delivery workers, and travelers with luggage. [drawer:Digital Curb Cuts](curb-cuts)

## Accessibility as a Human Right

Accessibility is increasingly recognized as a human right, with legal frameworks like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508, and the European Accessibility Act establishing requirements for accessible technology.
