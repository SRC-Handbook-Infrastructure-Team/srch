# What is Accessibility?

Entire populations are affected by the computational choices made in technology design. When thinking about how to incorporate accessibility into computer science pedagogy, it is crucial to understand that accessibility cannot exist under a single definition. For the purpose of this primer, accessibility will be framed through three categories.

1. Universality
2. Disability
3. Equity

Accessibility is often regarded as a priority that is superseded by functionality and efficiency. But accessibility is inseparable from the systems we are familiar with {we-are-familiar-with}, and is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives.

Technological accessibility is necessary in the creation of well-designed systems. How a system can be accessible will vary, but for its use in this primer, we will define something as accessible when **it takes into account the needs of its users, and then is designed with the intention of minimizing the barriers associated with those needs.**

## Accessibility through Universality

Universal design is a utilitarian approach to technological accessibility. While there exists contestation as to the exact definition of universal design, most definitions converge on the idea that it necessitates the design of an environment, be that digital or physical, constructed in a manner that makes it usable for all (or at the least most) people.[^2] {In-practice} this looks like systems that require little to no adaptation from the user because the design took into account, and catered itself to, the similarities between most people.

Because universal design often considers the most people that can be included in a design, it runs the risk of not addressing people with needs at the margins.

## Accessibility through Disability

There exist four main categories of disability: visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive. Individuals with disability may experience disability permanently, temporarily, and situationally.[^3] In the context of disability, accessibility can mean taking an explicit look at the needs of those with disability and designing in collaboration with those {perspectives}.

## Accessibility through Equity

Technological equity can be understood as the narrowed application of social equity. The Internet Society Foundation defines digital equity as "the state where every person and community has the necessary information technology resources to participate in society, democracy, and the economy fully."[^5] The barriers that keep people from equitable access to technology follow patterns of social disparity, meaning that factors such as income, gender, and race often correlate with digital inequity.

Disparities in digital access (referred to as the "digital divide") exacerbate disparate outcomes between marginalized and privileged groups in a tech-centered world.[^6] Digital equity is accessibility because it centers how different groups are able to access technology, and thus {can-be-addressed} in product design, computation, policy, and beyond.

## A Dynamic Approach to Accessibility

These definitions of accessibility are just three conceptions amid an entire field of scholarship. What makes digital accessibility exciting to think about is the way it is constantly changing and redefining itself given the context in which it is being evaluated. By using the framework of Universality, Disability, and Equity, we hope to clarify that there are facets to accessibility that one _must_ consider when interacting with, designing, and creating in the technological space.

## Case Study: WCAG 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Pre-recorded)

“A transcript is provided for audio-only content and a transcript or audio description is provided for video-only content.”[^1]

While this feature undoubtedly aids users with visual or hearing impairment, it also has the ability to benefit every user. Consider being in a library, and needing to listen to an audio clip for class. If you did not have headphones available, or the internet connection was making the video lag, you would be able to use the transcript instead.

## Case Study: High Contrast Screen Settings

The option to change one’s screen to high contrast is available on many of the most common operating systems—i.e. Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Students themselves use this feature since it is a default when they work on IDEs such as VSCode. While we may not think of high contrast as an explicit accessibility feature, it is built to make character distinction easier and less visually taxing than standard white or light screens with dark text.

## Case Study: iPhone Home Screens

iPhone home screens are both easy to navigate (they are compatible with screen readers and other assistive technology) and customizable. That way, there exists a convention users are familiar with (icons corresponding to apps that are clickable), while giving agency to users to format their device as they best see fit.

## Case Study: Hackathons[^4]

Hackathons hosted by organizations where the prompt is a well-intentioned call to create some technology meant to aid disabled people can be more harmful than helpful. These events often frame the users of this technology as fixed and separate from those designing the technology. Further, by framing the invention of assistive technology (or otherwise) in the brief span of a Hackathon, these events hide the extended, exhaustive process that goes into creating technology by and for disabled people.

## Case Study: Unified Payments Interface[^7] [^8]

In 2016, the National Payments Corporation of India established the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a single page mobile application that facilitates payment between parties in an efficient, accessible manner. UPI is managed by the Reserve Bank of India and partners with a variety of banks to allow users to access the service. UPI has been credited for including marginalized parties in a digital landscape with its ease and convenience of use, bolstering the Indian economy and reducing the cash-digital divide.

## Case Study: Black Girls Code [^9]

Black Girls Code is an organization that promotes the education of Black girls and young women in computation and technology. They recognize that only 2% of jobs in the tech sector are held by Black women and aim to improve those numbers.
