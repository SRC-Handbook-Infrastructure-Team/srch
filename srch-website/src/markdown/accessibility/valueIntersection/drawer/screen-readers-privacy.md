**Overview:**  
Screen readers are essential for users with visual impairments, converting on-screen text into speech or braille. Yet, when these tools read sensitive information (such as passwords or financial details) aloud in public, there’s a risk of privacy breaches. Additionally, some screen readers might not effectively convey security warnings, leaving users vulnerable to phishing or other attacks.

**Challenges Include:**

- Unintended disclosure of sensitive information in public settings
- Insufficient delivery of security-related messages by the screen reader
