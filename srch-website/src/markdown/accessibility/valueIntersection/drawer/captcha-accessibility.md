**Overview:**  
CAPTCHA tests distinguish human users from bots and enhance online security. However, traditional visual CAPTCHAs can be inaccessible for users with visual impairments, while audio CAPTCHA alternatives may pose challenges for those with hearing disabilities. These accessibility gaps can force users to adopt insecure workarounds, such as third-party CAPTCHA solvers, which introduce additional vulnerabilities.

**Challenges Include:**

- Accessibility barriers in both visual and audio CAPTCHA implementations
- Increased risk of security breaches when users resort to workarounds
