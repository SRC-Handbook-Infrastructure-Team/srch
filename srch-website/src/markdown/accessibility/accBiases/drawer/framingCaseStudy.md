A digital health app integrates *motivational nudges* for users with cognitive disabilities, using phrases like “Don’t miss out, log your medication now!” to encourage adherence. While early user engagement metrics show improvement, the use of loss-framing inadvertently induces stress among users with anxiety or executive dysfunction, who interpret the phrasing as punitive. This **framing**, intended to drive behavior, ends up discouraging use among the very population it supports. A reframed, gain-oriented message, such as “You're on track, log your medication to keep the streak going!” proves more inclusive by supporting motivation without invoking fear of failure.
