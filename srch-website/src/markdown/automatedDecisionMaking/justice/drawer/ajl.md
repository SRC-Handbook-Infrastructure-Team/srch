## Case Study: Algorithmic Justice League
The Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), founded by Joy Buolawmwini, is dedicated to combating bias in AI systems to ensure equitable treatment across diverse populations. The documentary Coded Bias explores the AJL’s discovery that facial recognition technologies act on embedded biases in their training data when failing to accurately identify darker-skinned faces. The film also shows Buolawmwini’s advocacy for legislation to address algorithmic biases that undermine equality of opportunity.
