# Individual Fairness (MOCK)

Individual fairness is based on the principle that "similar individuals should be treated similarly." This concept originates from work by Dwork et al. (2012).

## Mathematical Definition

Formally, given a distance metric d(x,y) that measures how similar individuals x and y are, and a distance metric D(f(x),f(y)) that measures how similar the decisions f(x) and f(y) are, individual fairness requires:

For all individuals x, y:
If d(x,y) is small, then D(f(x),f(y)) should also be small.

## Challenges

The main challenge in implementing individual fairness is defining an appropriate similarity metric. What makes two individuals "similar" is often subjective and context-dependent.

## Example

Consider a loan approval algorithm. Individual fairness would require that two people with similar financial histories, income levels, and debt-to-income ratios receive similar loan decisions, regardless of protected attributes like race or gender.
