# Procedural Fairness

Procedural fairness focuses on the process by which decisions are made rather than the outcomes. It emphasizes transparency, consistency, and the right to be heard.

## Key Elements

1. **Transparency** - Decision subjects should understand how decisions are made
2. **Consistency** - Similar cases should be treated similarly over time
3. **Voice** - Individuals should have an opportunity to present their case
4. **Neutrality** - Decision-makers should be unbiased
5. **Respect** - Individuals should be treated with dignity

## Example: Lending Algorithm

In a procedurally fair lending algorithm:

1. The factors used in the decision are clearly communicated to applicants
2. Applicants have a way to contest errors in their data
3. The algorithm is regularly audited for consistency
4. A human reviewer is available for edge cases
5. Rejection notices explain the primary reasons for the decision

## Research Findings

Research suggests that people are often more accepting of unfavorable outcomes when they perceive the process as fair, highlighting the importance of procedural fairness in algorithmic systems.
