# Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making (MOCK)

This primer explores different conceptions of fairness in the context of algorithmic decision-making systems and discusses their implications for policy and regulation.

## Introduction

Algorithmic fairness has become a central concern as automated systems increasingly influence decisions in areas like hiring, lending, criminal justice, and resource allocation. Different stakeholders may have different and sometimes conflicting notions of what constitutes "fairness."

This primer introduces key concepts of algorithmic fairness including individual fairness, group fairness, and procedural fairness. We'll discuss how these notions of fairness can sometimes be in tension with each other and explore the policy implications of these tensions.

## Key Fairness Concepts

### Individual Fairness

Individual fairness is based on the principle that similar individuals should be treated similarly. [drawer:Read more about Individual Fairness](individual-fairness)

### Group Fairness

Group fairness focuses on ensuring that protected groups (defined by attributes like race, gender, age, etc.) receive equitable treatment or outcomes. [drawer:Explore Group Fairness](group-fairness)

### Procedural Fairness

Procedural fairness emphasizes the fairness of the decision-making process rather than the outcomes. [drawer:See an example of Procedural Fairness](procedural-fairness)

## Policy Implications

The choice of fairness metric can lead to different policy outcomes. Policymakers should consider:

1. Which stakeholders' perspectives on fairness are prioritized
2. How to balance competing fairness notions
3. Domain-specific considerations that might inform fairness requirements
4. Transparency about chosen fairness metrics and their implications
