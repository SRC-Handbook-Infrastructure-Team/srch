# Bias in Algorithms

This primer explores different types of bias that can appear in algorithmic systems and their implications for fairness and equity.

## Introduction

Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes. These biases can emerge from many sources including the data used to train algorithms, design choices, and societal contexts in which the systems operate.

## Types of Algorithmic Bias

### Selection Bias

Selection bias occurs when the data used to train an algorithm is not representative of the population the algorithm will be used on. [drawer:More on Selection Bias](selection-bias)

### Measurement Bias

Measurement bias occurs when the features or labels chosen to represent a concept systematically fail to represent what they intend to measure. [drawer:Examples of Measurement Bias](measurement-bias)

### Historical Bias

Historical bias reflects existing societal biases in data, even when collected and processed perfectly. [drawer:Understanding Historical Bias](historical-bias)

## Detecting and Mitigating Bias

Detecting and addressing bias involves both technical and socio-technical approaches:

1. Diverse data collection
2. Fairness metrics and monitoring
3. Inclusive design processes
4. Regular auditing of systems
