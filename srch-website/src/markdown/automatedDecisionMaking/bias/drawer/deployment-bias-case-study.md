Criminal risk assessment tools are intended to model the risk of recidivism, the likelihood that a convicted criminal will commit a crime in the future. These algorithms are designed to assist judges in determining bail amounts and bail eligibility. **In practice, risk assessment tools (which predict the likelihood of future crime) are used to determine sentencing lengths (the punishment for a current crime conviction).**[^1]

Often arising out of a lack of AI literacy and overreliance on technology, deployment bias can have catastrophic human impact and undermine fairness in the criminal justice system.[^2] For a more thorough analysis of (in)justice in risk assessment tools, see the \[nav:Justice Primer\](justice).
