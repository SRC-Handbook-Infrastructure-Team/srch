# Procedural Equality Example

Procedural equality means applying the same decision-making process to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.

## Resume Screening Example

Consider an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that screens resumes:

1. The system scans all resumes for specific keywords
2. It ranks candidates based on keyword matches
3. Top-ranked candidates are selected for interviews

This process is "procedurally equal" because every resume goes through the same steps.

## The Equality Problem

However, this equality can be problematic if:

- Candidates from different backgrounds use different terminology for the same skills
- Some candidates didn't have the same educational opportunities
- The keywords themselves may embed historical biases

This is why **equity** (accounting for differences) can be more important than strict equality in many contexts.
