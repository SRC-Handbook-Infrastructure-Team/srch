# Fairness & Justice

When machines replace humans in making decisions with such great impact, it is important for their outcomes to remain fair and just. But what is algorithmic fairness and justice?

## Procedural Equality vs. Equity

One common criteria for fairness within the technical community is procedural equality.

**Procedural Equality**: Everyone is subject to the same decision-making process. [drawer:See Example](procedural-equality-example)

For example, ATS, or applicant tracking systems, are automated decision-making systems that employers use to screen resumes for hiring. Procedural equality is achieved when the system runs every application in the same way.

## Types of Fairness

There are several types of fairness measures:

- **Individual Fairness**: [drawer:See Definition](individual-fairness) Similar individuals receive similar outcomes
- **Group Fairness**: [drawer:See Definition](group-fairness) Groups receive equitable treatment
