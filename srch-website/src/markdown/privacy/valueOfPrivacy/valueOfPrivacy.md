# What is the value of privacy?

## What is privacy good for?

As previously seen, privacy can be [**understood**](whatIsPrivacy) in a myriad of ways. While conceptions of privacy vary, there is broad agreement that privacy facilitates certain {goods}for both individuals and society at large. The way people determine and prioritize these goods depends on their understanding of privacy.

This section provides a broad set of goods {across-definitions} without any particular ordering.

Many people hold the belief that privacy does not have value. This is often framed in questions similar to “if I’ve done nothing wrong, why do I need privacy?” Rather than countering this argument directly, we present the ways privacy could be useful across contexts. We strive to answer the guiding question: “what is privacy good for?”

### Privacy in Society

On a societal level, privacy may be useful in supporting a functional, {liberal-democratic-system}, particularly as it facilitates agency, equality, and decision-making. Some of the benefits of privacy may include:

- {Protection-from-Violence-and-Bad-Actors}
- {Development-of-Countercultures}
- {Political-Participation-Without-Judgment}
- {Fairness-by-Obscuring-Identity}
- {Private-Control-of-Property}
- {Creating-Different-Relationships}

### Privacy for Individuals

Privacy may also support several goods that we may want as individuals, separate from the broader benefits that they bring to society. These include:

- {Increased-Agency-Over-Self-and-Actions}
- {Personal-Development-Through-Experimentation}
- {Ability-to-not-be-Seen-as-a-Particular-Identity-or-Characteristic}
- {Allows-Different-People-to-Know-Different-Things-About-Oneself}

## Who benefits from privacy?

The value of privacy may vary significantly depending on who you are and what your corresponding needs are.

If you exist as part of a large group (which you do!), then it’s possible to use the characteristics of that group in aggregate to {learn-information-about-all-members} of the group that wouldn’t be available otherwise. Group membership may also be exploited to {gain-knowledge-about-a-specific-individual} that could be used to target them. More intentionally formed groups, such as government agencies, businesses, activist organizations, {might-also-seek-out-privacy} for various purposes.

People in {historically-marginalized-groups}(historicallyMarginalizedGroups) may also place increased value on privacy. This may be due to harassment on the basis of identity, from both organizations (state actors) and individuals. Marginalized groups are also more likely to disagree with normative status quo that causes them to be marginalized, and may wish to experiment outside of these boundaries to prioritize justice goals. From this, there may also be a want to not be seen based upon the basis of their identity, or to associate with others in a manner that deviates from social norms and regulations.

## Complicating Privacy

Privacy is highly context-specific. As previously discussed, individuals and groups may place different values and priorities on privacy depending on their background, demographics, and needs.  
Specifically, the types and amounts of privacy individuals seek from governments or corporations may be quite different from the privacy they want from family members or friends. In both cases, what’s valued may also vary, as the value of privacy from institutions may relate more to social connections and control than identity and development.

Privacy may privacy trade-offs—some of which were seen in this section–with other values, and may cause harm in some cases. We step away from this discussion in this section to maintain focus on the role privacy fills.

Privacy may also {conflict-with-itself} in some scenarios, as two different parties may want privacy in a mutually incompatible way. Here, who receives privacy when is called into question. Regulations serve to systematize these choices.

goods:
Heading: Goods Defintion
A good, in this context, is any social or individual benefit or value. Goods may conflict with each other and are often non-universally experienced, typically coming with trade-offs.

across-definitions:
Heading: Disclaimer
This section does not cover differential privacy. For more information, view the section focusing on the goods and trade-offs that come from differential privacy specifically.

liberal-democratic-system:
Heading: Disclaimer
This section focuses on this type of system in alignment with the broadstanding emphasis on issues and philosophies in computing within the West (i.e. US and EU). “Liberal democracy” is used here to describe a form of governance that allows collective, equal, representative decision-making that provides individuals the opportunity to act both politically and personally as they see fit. This definition is open to immense debate, which we sidestep for now. Differing conceptions of privacy exist outside of this framework and lead to different values, which is beyond the scope of this section.

Protection-from-Violence-and-Bad-Actors:
Generally, privacy may act as a shield against having action and identity be observed, preventing violence between people on this basis. This works well when using an access-based approach to privacy.

This is visible in a counterexample where someone loses privacy. “Swatting” is a technical instance of this, where the data of specific individuals are compromised and misused to place fraudulent calls about a serious, dangerous event where those compromised people are. These calls [often take advantage of modern phone technologies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10058781&tag=1) to protect the harasser’s own privacy. In doing this, the goal is to provoke a heavily armed, militant police response (typically with specialized hostage rescue and special weapons teams) to harass and attack the individual. This may happen to [public figures](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816030937/https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/08/15/keffals-adin-ross-ishowspeed-swatting-twitch-youtube/) and [non-public figures](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/staff-us-voting-machine-firms-prep-doxxing-misinformation-swatting-2024-11-01/).

Alternatively, a positive example is [Address Confidentiality Programs (ACPs)](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/dcujl6&i=217). ACPs obscure the home addresses of victims of domestic violence, stalking, and assault by providing them with a generic substitute address that can be used for mail forwarding and public records, preventing bad actors from accessing their location through these records. In turn, this prevents ongoing violence between individuals.

Development-of-Countercultures:
In private or semi-private settings, individuals may be better able to challenge norms and push back against a wider status quo without fear of social or political retribution. In doing so, broader social norms can be identified as restrictive standards that can be rejected and further improved. Grassroots changes in social norms and institutions may occur as a result. This works well when thinking about privacy as defining private spheres of place and action.

Anonymous forums serve as an example of this. YikYak, now Sidechat, is a version of these forums that targets college students and allows anonymous posting when a user is within the bounds of a college campus. [Users of the app describe the dual issue with anonymity](https://bruknow.library.brown.edu/discovery/openurl?institution=01BU_INST&vid=01BU_INST:BROWN&aulast=Tripodi&id=doi:10.2307%2Fj.ctt1t89cfr.22&auinit=F&atitle=Yakking%20about%20college%20life:%20Examining%20the%20role%20of%20anonymous%20forums%20on%20community%20identity%20formation&sid=google), noting that people on the app are more likely to express more nuanced and positive feelings than they would otherwise be willing to share because of the anonymity, but also that this same anonymity allows users to also be more hateful. Other research on different online spaces repeats this same tension on anonymity, showing these forums as places where [hateful ideologies can be developed](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315728346-21/none-new-media-alice-marwick), but also where [queer connection can flourish](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/hcrcl38&i=168) and [women may find safety from harassment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2675133.2675175).

Political-Participation-Without-Judgment:
Privacy can hide the actions someone takes, either completely or only to certain people or groups. As a result, the perceived ethical impact of those actions are also made unavailable. This allows individuals to take actions without broader judgment from others, facilitating individualized decision-making that is free from social pressure. This hiding is often seen as a prerequisite to allowing free and equal decision-making by individuals that supports liberal democracy. This works well when thinking about privacy as something that delineates certain private spheres of action.

An example in modern practice is a voting booth. Even as party affiliation and the act of voting may be public information, how someone votes remains secret in most cases. Along a practical dimension, secret ballots prevent voter intimidation, coercion, and buying, allowing a vote to be actually reflective of the individual voter’s interests [rather than of someone who may exercise power over them](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/729169/pdf). Ballot secrecy also supports the egalitarian view that anyone in a democratic society should be able to elect a [government without particular qualification](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/85A2E2D6D191AADA21D84BDB56E5F903/S0953820807002634a.pdf/mill_and_the_secret_ballot_beyond_coercion_and_corruption.pdf). This allows elections to be both [free (in that they are not coercive, including violently so) and fair](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16828) (in that treatment of people does not differ based on their vote). This is complicated when people may break privacy in the voting booth, [either via tampering with electronic voting machines](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301313) or by taking [ballot selfies](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/jlawp26&i=355).

Private-Control-of-Property:
Certain definitions of privacy focus on the separation of the [**public and private spheres**](/whatIsPrivacy), including how much control an individual has over those areas. This has implications both ways. Using public resources is a public action, which allows for enforcement of particular regulations against how that resource might be used, serving some wider public interest. At the same time, private control of a resource lets someone use that resource for their private interest, providing them agency. This works well when thinking about privacy as a conduit for control or that allows a private sphere of action.

An example of this in regulation is the third amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While there might be a prevailing public interest to require that soldiers are able to live in people’s homes, the private interest to have control over intimate and vulnerable spaces takes precedence. In essence, there is a [defined private space that’s separate from the public where someone cannot be coerced](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/valur26&i=271). Some readings of the third amendment [extend this idea to modern tech and surveillance](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/wflron4&i=7), especially as the government may enter homes digitally through consumer technology, enforcing a type of “quartering.”

Creating-Different-Relationships:
Knowing certain Information about people–particularly the relationships that they have with others–requires also knowing information about others. Without privacy protections, individuals do not have control over how they are seen by others, losing control over how this affects their relationships. People can no longer moderate how they present themselves, preventing them from cultivating different types of relationships in a productive manner. This can be appreciated from the intuitive sense that we want our significant other to know different things about us than our boss might. These differences in the types of relationships a person might have are broadly viewed as a foundational aspect of cultivating trust and subsequent community building, underscoring privacy as a prerequisite for a functional society. This works well when using a control-based approach to privacy.

An example of this in practice covers digital sex workers. Digital sex workers (such as those on pornography or subscription platforms) frequently hold dual roles, working other jobs alongside their digital work. When employers find out about people doing digital sex work, often without the worker’s intent, this can alter the employer-worker relationship and lead to [workplace discrimination](https://www.vice.com/en/article/employers-sex-work-cost-of-living/), [firings](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-27/sex-work-discrimination-laws-victoria-employment-vcat/103632868), and [difficulties in finding future work](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sex-work-mainstream-job-employment_n_60a3f040e4b09092480941fc). In educational settings, this type of disclosure and discrimination [is a Title IX violation](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/oregon/ordce/6:2019cv00283/143726/165/).

Fairness-by-Obscuring-Identity:
An obscured aspect of one’s identity is no longer available to others to support segregation or discrimination along those lines. Individuals _must_ be treated equally on the basis of that characteristic, as no information is made available – there is a veil of ignorance. This is distinct from other conceptions of fairness which may incorporate justice and equity principles along with equality. This works well when using an access-based approach to privacy.

Sexuality is an instance where this value may be important. Sexual relationships may be viewed as something that should be private to someone and their partner, which calls into question who should have access to knowledge about these relationships and when. As it’s possible to [infer sexuality from digital behavior](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1218772110) and [sexual minorities report discrimination due to disclosure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819984/) in private spheres, being able to obfuscate identity becomes a pressing issue.

Another instance may be “Ban the Box” movements, pushing employers to not include questions about prior criminal history on job applications. By not asking about this background, those with criminal histories experience [less discrimination in hiring and are more likely to find employment](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/ilr104&i=1107). At the same time, privacy in this area has spillover trade-offs, with some research suggesting that it [decreases hiring rates overall for other demographics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/705880) that already experience discrimination in hiring.

Increased-Agency-Over-Self-and-Actions:
People have knowledge about themselves and who they are from facts about themselves, self-understanding, and how others perceive them. These things help create an identity. Privacy allows someone to manage the extent that this information and their identity is exposed to others, exercising agency over how they are publicly perceived. By controlling how others perceive them, this self-creation is an active process that requires agency over one’s own actions. This is connected to control-based conceptions of privacy.

One example of a violation of this might be location-based targeted advertising. What we do is often dependent on where we are, often in intimate ways. On a high level, [large online advertising services](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043?hl=en) may offer location targeting services, often operating on the level of zip or postal codes. In combination with demographic (identity) data, this can be used to target ads and influence a small group of individuals at any time. In the most extreme cases, this might be used to harass, intimidate, and influence through specialized advertising. Other [services may provide real-time GPS data](https://www.vice.com/en/article/hundreds-bounty-hunters-att-tmobile-sprint-customer-location-data-years/), allowing for, in one instance, women seeking an abortion to be [targeted directly by ads for anti-abortion clinics](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2016/05/25/anti-choice-groups-deploy-smartphone-surveillance-target-abortion-minded-women-clinic-visits/).

Personal-Development-Through-Experimentation:
People may change themselves and their identities over time. To facilitate this change, some safe experimentation with facets of one’s identity is needed. Privacy allows for this, providing a buffer between a public realm, where identity and perception may generally be fixed and have unwanted connotations, and a private realm, where identity may be more easily altered and exist without external connotations. In practice, the facets of one’s identity that are unknown and private to others are changeable without others being aware of the change, providing this fluidity. This is related to the separation that may exist between public and private spheres.

_Tearoom Trade_ provides both an instance and a counter-example of this creation. _Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places_ is a book by Laud Humphreys published in 1970, exploring the methods, practices, and demographics of men who have anonymous sex with men in secluded public areas, referred to as “tearooms.” The work highlights the fact that many men in the research presented themselves as heterosexual in other facets of their life, including to their wives. By engaging with tearooms, these men are able to cultivate two contrasting identities and rework popular understandings of what it means to be homosexual.

At the same time, Humphreys’s work relied heavily on deceit and tracking to gather data for his work. _Tearoom Trade_ has been [openly critiqued](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.11519906.11) on this basis, pointing out that Humphreys openly disregarded the privacy of his research subjects by failing to inform them that they were participating in his research or that he had collected any information about their sexual behaviors. By violating these participants' privacy in this way, his work also challenges the environment of “safe experimentation” that tearooms may provide.

Ability-to-not-be-Seen-as-a-Particular-Identity-or-Characteristic:
Privacy allows people to obscure specific aspects of themselves, preempting potential judgement on the basis of those characteristics. Without these characteristics to rely on, others are forced to rely only on the information that is actively shared with them. Privacy, in this sense, acts as a humanizing force, rather than as a reducing one.

One instance of this process in action is through students attempting to hide their socioeconomic status at “elite” high schools and colleges. Anthony Abraham Jack discusses this in detail in The Privileged Poor, noting how many poorer students at these institutions will work to control knowledge of their background, both to integrate better with their wealthier peers and reveal hardships when convenient for social mobility. By selectively choosing when to reveal their background, these students prevent themselves from being othered and viewed as poor, managing impressions and forcing their peers to rely on other information–and assumptions–about who they are.

Allows-Different-People-to-Know-Different-Things-About-Oneself:
People may want different categories of individuals to know them in different ways. As an example, we can appreciate the fact that someone may want their boss to know them in a different light than their parents or significant other. Privacy allows people to control the flow of information to all of these people in their lives, forcing them to rely on different sets of information about that person in the context relevant to them. This supports the creation of varied, equally important relationships on an individual level, supporting broader flourishing and meaningful connections.

One instance of this is people maintaining multiple social media accounts. “Throwaway” accounts on Reddit are an extreme example, as users will make an account to only make one post, separating it from the rest of their user history out of caution and preventing [other users from knowing _anything_ else about themselves](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359237). Users on Instagram may use “finsta” (fake Instagram) and “rinsta” (real instagram) accounts, [providing different outlooks on their lives](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3512916), often to a cultivated, gatekept audience. The finsta accounts are often more informal, emotional, and off-beat, typically revealing more intimate and uncurated moments on a more frequent basis. The audience on a finsta is more likely to be attuned to the broader context of a user’s life and, in turn, have a different relationship with the user than someone only following that user’s rinsta.

learn-information-about-all-members:
This is often articulated in terms of “group privacy,” which might also be thought about as “[the right to huddle](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/rutlj8&i=235).”

[One version of this is the algorithmic creation of groups from individual data](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13347-017-0253-7.pdf), revealing group associations and connections that would otherwise not be visible. By creating this group, the data of one person can inform knowledge from the data of someone else, involuntarily revealing information about them. The creation of these groups might also place unwanted identity labels on individuals, challenging control over their identity.

Critically, group privacy extends to groups that are intentionally and unintentionally formed by its members. Even as the members themselves might be anonymous, [it’s frequently possible that the information revealed by the group itself is enough](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/52825/1/978-3-030-82786-1.pdf#page=97) to identify and draw conclusions about its members. This has technical implications for privacy-conscious systems and political implications for some rights, such as freedom of association.

gain-knowledge-about-a-specific-individual:
It’s often possible to use metadata to re-identify and find connections between hidden individuals. For re-identification (or deanonymization), it’s possible to use the data of an anonymous user to successfully re-identify them, extending to [location data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17489725.2024.2385312#abstract), [open datasets shared across platforms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401215301262), and [user metadata](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15010). On the other hand, it’s possible to learn and predict information about an individual from their group affiliations. This is a form of social network analysis, which has successfully extracted notable individuals, even from [low-information](https://culturalanalytics.org/article/68188-how-network-analysis-uncovers-international-networks-of-smuggling-history-criminals-in-nagasaki-japan-circa-1667), [historical](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) datasets.

might-also-seek-out-privacy:
The primary example of this is governments holding state secrets in the interest of national security. This active withholding of information–rather than just the lack of accessibility–is a form of privacy that governments hold from other countries and, often, their own citizens. Whether this privacy ought to exist [is a debated issue](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13698230.2018.1482097), particularly as this may come into conflict with ideals of accountability and transparency. Alternatively, a company may seek out privacy to protect their trade secrets, competitive advantage, and details of their customers, although this profit-motivated right to privacy [is often seen as weaker](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/mnlr99&i=39) than individual rights to privacy. Advocacy groups have a stronger claim to this type of privacy, as they often operate along legally protected characteristics and seek to enact [collective digital privacy by design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016740482200013X).

historically-marginalized-groups:
Many formal and informal groups may seek this kind of privacy. This includes, but is not limited to:

- [Racial and ethnic communities](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00936502241273157)
- [LGBT+ communities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00107)
- [Advocacy groups and political dissidents](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/nyregion/college-campus-protests-anonymity.html)
- [Incarcerated populations](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/soc4.12847)
- [Immigrant communities](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3173688)
- [Unions and professional organizations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3555574)
- [Illness and patient groups](https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/what-electronic-health-records-don-t-know-just/docview/2919545076/se-2?accountid=9758)
- [Religious communities](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2009_1/cannataci)
- [Specialized interest and hobby groups](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05m5m5v327o)
- [Linguistic communities](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13278-022-01017-0.pdf)
- [Low-income groups](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2182773)

conflict-with-itself:
One example of this is [forensic investigation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43741598?seq=3). By collecting some data of many people to begin with, when an investigation is needed, more people can be excluded based on the beginning data and will not have their privacy needlessly violated. If this doesn’t occur, then more people will need to be investigated deeply, requiring a trade-off in who gets privacy, even if the average amount of privacy between individuals is the same.
