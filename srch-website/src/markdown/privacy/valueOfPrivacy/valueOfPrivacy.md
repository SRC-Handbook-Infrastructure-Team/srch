# What is the value of privacy?

## What is privacy good for?

As previously seen, privacy can be [nav:understood](privacy/whatIsPrivacy) in a myriad of ways. While conceptions of privacy vary, there is broad agreement that privacy facilitates certain [drawer:goods](goodsDefinition) for both individuals and society at large. The way people determine and prioritize these goods depends on their understanding of privacy.

This section provides a broad set of goods [drawer:across definitions](mutlipleDefinitionsDisclaimer) without any particular ordering.

Many people hold the belief that privacy does not have value. This is often framed in questions similar to “if I’ve done nothing wrong, why do I need privacy?” Rather than countering this argument directly, we present the ways privacy could be useful across contexts. We strive to answer the guiding question: “what is privacy good for?”

### Privacy in Society

On a societal level, privacy may be useful in supporting a functional, [drawer:liberal democratic system](libDemDisclaimer), particularly as it facilitates agency, equality, and decision-making. Some of the benefits of privacy may include:

- [drawer:Protection from violence and bad actors](violenceBadActors)
- [drawer:Development of countercultures](devOfCountercultures)
- [drawer:Political participation without judgment](politicalParticipationJudgement)
- [drawer:Fairness by obscuring identity](fairnessObscuringIdentity)
- [drawer:Private control of property](privateControlProperty)
- [drawer:Creating different relationships](creatingDifferentRelationships)

### Privacy for Individuals

Privacy may also support several goods that we may want as individuals, separate from the broader benefits that they bring to society. These include:

- [drawer:Increased agency over self & actions](agencySelfActions)
- [drawer:Personal development through experimentation](personalDevelopmentExperimentation)
- [drawer:Ability to not be seen as a particular identity or characteristic](notBeSeenID)
- [drawer:Allows different people to know different things about oneself](knowDifferentThings)

## Who benefits from privacy?

The value of privacy may vary significantly depending on who you are and what your corresponding needs are.

If you exist as part of a large group (which you do!), then it’s possible to use the characteristics of that group in aggregate to [drawer:learn information about all members](learnAllMembers) of the group that wouldn’t be available otherwise. Group membership may also be exploited to [drawer:gain knowledge about a specific individual](gainKnowledgeIndividual) that could be used to target them. More intentionally formed groups, such as government agencies, businesses, activist organizations, [drawer:might also seek out privacy](groupSeekPrivacy)for various purposes.

People in [drawer:historically marginalized groups](historicallyMarginalizedGroups) may also place increased value on privacy. This may be due to harassment on the basis of identity, from both organizations (state actors) and individuals. Marginalized groups are also more likely to disagree with normative status quo that causes them to be marginalized, and may wish to experiment outside of these boundaries to prioritize justice goals. From this, there may also be a want to not be seen based upon the basis of their identity, or to associate with others in a manner that deviates from social norms and regulations.

## Complicating Privacy

Privacy is highly context-specific. As previously discussed, individuals and groups may place different values and priorities on privacy depending on their background, demographics, and needs.  
Specifically, the types and amounts of privacy individuals seek from governments or corporations may be quite different from the privacy they want from family members or friends. In both cases, what’s valued may also vary, as the value of privacy from institutions may relate more to social connections and control than identity and development.

Privacy may [nav:come with trade-offs](privacy/privacyTradeOffs)–some of which were seen in this section–with other values, and may cause harm in some cases. We step away from this discussion in this section to maintain focus on the role privacy fills.

Privacy may also [drawer:conflict with itself](conflictWithItself) in some scenarios, as two different parties may want privacy in a mutually incompatible way. Here, who receives privacy when is called into question. Regulations serve to systematize these choices.
