The primary example of this is governments holding state secrets in the interest of national security. This active withholding of information–rather than just the lack of accessibility–is a form of privacy that governments hold from other countries and, often, their own citizens. Whether this privacy ought to exist [is a debated issue](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13698230.2018.1482097), particularly as this may come into conflict with ideals of accountability and transparency. Alternatively, a company may seek out privacy to protect their trade secrets, competitive advantage, and details of their customers, although this profit-motivated right to privacy [is often seen as weaker](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/mnlr99&i=39) than individual rights to privacy. Advocacy groups have a stronger claim to this type of privacy, as they often operate along legally protected characteristics and seek to enact [collective digital privacy by design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016740482200013X).
