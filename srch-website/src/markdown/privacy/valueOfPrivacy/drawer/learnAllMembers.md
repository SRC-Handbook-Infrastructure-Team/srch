This is often articulated in terms of “group privacy,” which might also be thought about as “[the right to huddle](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/rutlj8&i=235).” 

[One version of this is the algorithmic creation of groups from individual data](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13347-017-0253-7.pdf), revealing group associations and connections that would otherwise not be visible. By creating this group, the data of one person can inform knowledge from the data of someone else, involuntarily revealing information about them. The creation of these groups might also place unwanted identity labels on individuals, challenging control over their identity. 

Critically, group privacy extends to groups that are intentionally and unintentionally formed by its members. Even as the members themselves might be anonymous, [it’s frequently possible that the information revealed by the group itself is enough](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/52825/1/978-3-030-82786-1.pdf#page=97) to identify and draw conclusions about its members. This has technical implications for privacy-conscious systems and political implications for some rights, such as freedom of association.
