Privacy allows people to obscure specific aspects of themselves, preempting potential judgement on the basis of those characteristics. Without these characteristics to rely on, others are forced to rely only on the information that is actively shared with them. Privacy, in this sense, acts as a humanizing force, rather than as a reducing one. 

One instance of this process in action is through students attempting to hide their socioeconomic status at “elite” high schools and colleges. Anthony Abraham Jack discusses this in detail in *The Privileged Poor*, noting how many poorer students at these institutions will work to control knowledge of their background, both to integrate better with their wealthier peers and reveal hardships when convenient for social mobility. By selectively choosing when to reveal their background, these students prevent themselves from being othered and viewed as poor, managing impressions and forcing their peers to rely on other information–and assumptions–about who they are.
