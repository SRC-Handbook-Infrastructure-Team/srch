Contextual integrity is applicable in legal and policy discussions of privacy. Its advocates assert that it is more comprehensive than the predominant [Fair Information Practice Principles](https://www.fpc.gov/resources/fipps/) (FIPPs) model.

The information flow control (IFC) model in cybersecurity can be seen as operationalizing Nissenbaum’s principle of appropriate flow. IFC focuses on “what information is authorized to be transferred between entities” (Wheeler 2011, 269). To learn more, see Wheeler’s book [*Security Risk Management*](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.revproxy.brown.edu/lib/brown/detail.action?docID=685406).

Not all aspects of Nissenbaum’s theory are straightforward to operationalize (e.g. some transmission principles such as “with consent”). IFC systems that allow for more nuanced control are an active area of research. The 2024 paper [“Sesame: Practical End-to-End Privacy Compliance with Policy Containers and Privacy Regions”](https://doi.org/10.1145/3694715.3695984) from Brown’s Efficient and Trustworthy Operating Systems (ETOS) Group is an example of such work.
