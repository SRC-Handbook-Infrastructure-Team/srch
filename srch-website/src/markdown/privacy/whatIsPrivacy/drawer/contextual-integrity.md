# Contextual Integrity Theory

Contextual Integrity (CI) is a privacy framework developed by Helen Nissenbaum that suggests privacy violations occur when information flows in ways that breach context-specific norms.

## Key Components

CI frames privacy in terms of:

1. **Information Flows**: The transmission of personal information from one party to another
2. **Contexts**: Social settings with their own norms and values (e.g., healthcare, education, commerce)
3. **Roles**: The positions people occupy within contexts (e.g., doctor, patient, teacher, student)
4. **Principles**: The norms that govern appropriate information flows within contexts

## The CI Heuristic

To evaluate whether a privacy violation has occurred, CI considers:

- **Actors**: Who is sending and receiving the information?
- **Attributes**: What type of information is being transmitted?
- **Transmission Principles**: Under what conditions is the information shared?

## Example

In a healthcare context, a doctor sharing a patient's test results with a specialist follows contextual integrity, but sharing the same information with an advertiser likely violates it, even with consent, because it contradicts established healthcare information norms.
