const e=`Knowing certain Information about people–particularly the relationships that they have with others–requires also knowing information about others. Without privacy protections, individuals do not have control over how they are seen by others, losing control over how this affects their relationships. People can no longer moderate how they present themselves, preventing them from cultivating different types of relationships in a productive manner. This can be appreciated from the intuitive sense that we want our significant other to know different things about us than our boss might.  These differences in the types of relationships a person might have are broadly viewed as a foundational aspect of cultivating trust and subsequent community building, underscoring privacy as a prerequisite for a functional society. This works well when using a control-based approach to privacy.\r
