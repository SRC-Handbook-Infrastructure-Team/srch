const e=`# Procedural Equality Example\r
\r
Procedural equality means applying the same decision-making process to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.\r
\r
## Resume Screening Example\r
\r
Consider an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that screens resumes:\r
\r
1. The system scans all resumes for specific keywords\r
2. It ranks candidates based on keyword matches\r
3. Top-ranked candidates are selected for interviews\r
\r
This process is "procedurally equal" because every resume goes through the same steps.\r
\r
## The Equality Problem\r
\r
However, this equality can be problematic if:\r
\r
- Candidates from different backgrounds use different terminology for the same skills\r
- Some candidates didn't have the same educational opportunities\r
- The keywords themselves may embed historical biases\r
\r
This is why **equity** (accounting for differences) can be more important than strict equality in many contexts. `;export{e as default};
