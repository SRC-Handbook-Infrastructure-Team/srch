# Introduction to Copyright and Generative AI

US Copyright law has been completely upended by the rise of claims using generative artificial intelligence. For example, currently, under US copyright law, artistic style is not itself copyrightable and only finished works themselves are. Artistic styles being uncopyrightable has become an issue in the AI copyright space, as distinctive styles themselves are becoming increasingly generated without any credit to artists themselves due to models training on an abundance of artist’s works. This generative phenomenon has been increasingly present, but was highlighted in 2025 with OpenAI’s image generator that was capable of easily generating images in the style of Hayao Miyazaki, the co-founder of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli. With OpenAI training its models on copious amounts of Studio Ghibli media, users were able to attach an image or request an image be generated in Miyazaki’s style with ease without any copyright filters. This training presented an issue of the legality of training AI models on art and copyrighted content. But, the output of the studio ghibli style presented the issue of who owns, if anyone, the copyright of AI generated content? Proponents against these generations argue that decades of artistic hard work has been exploited. The Studio Ghibli trend was not the only instance of artistic work being used for AI training without permission, but merely highlighted the issue.

## What is the difference between IP and Copyright?

![Copyright bubble graph](/srch-s25/public/assets/primer-photos/Copyright.jpg)
Intellectual Property (IP) is the broad legal category that protects the creations of the mind through patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Copyright is a specific type of IP that protects original creative works such as books, music, and art from unauthorized use.

## Copyright on inputs: what is the legality of training models on copyrighted data?

Influential AI models such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and more are trained on massive datasets that have been scraped from the internet. Oftentimes, these datasets contain copyrighted material such as music, text, images and art. Because models have been trained on tremendous amounts of media, lawsuits have been filed against AI developers, arguing that training artificial intelligence on copyrighted works without permission is copyright infringement. However, AI developers argue that scraping data from the internet that may contain copyrighted material and using it for model training is allowed under the Fair Use Doctrine of the 1976 Copyright Act. The lack of centralized clarity on the legality of training AI models on copyrighted data has resulted in a legal grey area across the United States.

### Copyright on outputs: are AI-generated outputs copyrightable?

With the rise of multimodal artificial intelligence, AI models can now output various types of media such as text, audio, images, and art. These diverse outputs raise the question of if AI-generated media can be copyrightable. The United States Copyright Office (USCO) and judicial courts have repeatedly ruled that human authorship is required for something to be copyrightable, meaning that AI-generated works without human creativity cannot be copyrighted. The human creativity requirement means that a user cannot simply prompt an AI model and copyright the output. However, if a user provides significant creative input alongside the AI generated output, then ownership could be potentially claimed. Because the level of required human contribution and creativity is relatively undetermined, questions regarding if AI-generated outputs are copyrightable or not remain an open question for various situations.

## Copyright on AI-Inputs

AI copyright issues related to inputs—particularly the use of copyrighted data for training AI models—are at the center of major legal and policy debates. These concerns primarily involve whether training AI models such as ChatGPT, Suno, Udio, Stability AI, and Midjourney on copyrighted materials constitutes copyright infringement or is valid under the Fair Use Doctrine. When developing AI models, especially ones at scale, developers will oftentimes scrape the internet to acquire enormous amounts of media that includes text, images, video, and art to train the model. As stated before, the items that have been scraped from the internet to train AI models are sometimes copyrighted, and owners are not given compensation or asked for consent for this training. This has resulted in copyright owners seeing their work resembles in AI outputs, negatively affecting their profits, copyrights, and artistic autonomy, potentially resulting in infringement.

### Current Legal Landscape

While there are no official laws passed in the United States regarding Generative AI training and Copyright, two notable pieces of federal legislation such as the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act of 2024 and the TRAIN Act have been introduced for this issue. Moreover, there are numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers for copyright infringement in AI training data, including notable plaintiffs such as the New York Times, Getty Images, and the Recording Industry Association of America.

### Federal Efforts

The Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act of 2024 and The Transparency and Responsibility for Artificial Intelligence Networks (TRAIN) Act have been introduced to both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate. These bills concern how AI developers should disclose the fact that they have used copyrighted work and how owners of copyrighted media can use legal tools against AI developers who they think trained their models on copyrighted work.

#### Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act of 2024

The Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act is a piece of legislation that was introduced by then Representative Adam Schiff in 2024 to the U.S. House of Representatives. The act requires that a notice must be submitted to the Register of Copyrights with respect to copyrighted works used in building generative AI systems approximately thirty days before the public release of a model. If actors fail to submit, they are subject to penalties of at minimum $5000. The goal of the act is for companies to be more transparent about when they are using copyrighted media in their generative AI training. The bill has been supported by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), ASCAP, Black Music Action Coalition (BMAC), and Human Artistry Campaign.

#### The Transparency and Responsibility for Artificial Intelligence Networks (TRAIN) Act

The Transparency and Responsibility for Artificial Intelligence Networks Act is a piece of legislation that was introduced by Senator Peter Welch. The act aims to create an administrative subpoena process to assist copyright owners in determining which of their copyrighted works have been used in the training of artificial intelligence models, if the holder can declare a “good faith belief” that their work was used to train the model. During the subpoena process, developers would need to reveal as to whether or not the work was used to train an AI model, and if so, compensate artists for this usage. According to the act, failure to comply with the subpoena process would be a legal assumption that the AI developer did indeed use the copyrighted work. Supporters of this bill include the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the American Federation of Musicians, the Recording Academy, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Group.

### The Fair Use Doctrine and Lawsuits

The Fair Use doctrine is one of the most critical components of copyright law that AI developers use to defend themselves against copyright complaints. Fair Use is the legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like, criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. When trying to determine whether Fair Use applies to certain cases, courts must use a four factor test which specify:

- The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes. This factor asks if the material has been used to help create something new or is it copied in detail into simply another work.
- The nature of the copyrighted work, or, what the work is.
- The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole (amount of the original work used, especially if it is the ‘heart’ of the work)
- The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work (how the use will impact the market of the original work).

| **Factor**                     | **Explanation**                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose and character of use   | Is the use transformative or merely a copy? Is it commercial or nonprofit?   |
| Nature of the copyrighted work | Is the original work more factual or creative in nature?                     |
| Amount and substantiality      | How much of the original work is used, and is the “heart” of the work taken? |
| Effect on market               | Does the use harm the market or value of the original work?                  |

For example, in Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence, the judge ruled in favor of Reuters using factor one and factor four, in that when using Reuters data, Ross Intelligence was merely trying to create a product that was similar enough to Reuters AND most importantly that the use of the data would negatively impact the Reuter’s market and profits. Many AI developers have stated that using copyrighted work scraped from the internet is allowed under the Fair Use Doctrine, especially that the Fair Use Doctrine applies to AI models for scholarship and research purposes. Moreover, there are further arguments that AI developers should use copyrighted work to achieve AI dominance on the global scale, as well as create better represented datasets that will result in less bias and more fairness.

#### Response: How Artists are Seeking to Protect their Copyrighted Work

In response to the ambiguity in US Copyright law regarding whether copyrighted material can be used for AI training, artists have developed various tools to protect their work. These tools include masking tools such as Mist, Anti-DreamBooth, and Glaze, data poisoning methods such as Nightshade, and usage of AI protected platforms such as Cara, which automatically apply nightshade to protect artists' work. Other tools include websites such as haveibeentrained.com, which allow users to check if their work is present in popular AI training datasets.

## Copyright on AI-Outputs

The United States Copyright Office has determined that minimal user input, for example, entering a text prompt into a generative AI tool like DALL·E or Midjourney, is not enough for material to be copyrighted. However, if a user modifies the AI output significantly, or curates and arranges it in a creative way, those modifications may be protected.

### Current Legal Landscape

At the moment, courts must determine whether AI-generated outputs are derivative or transformative enough to qualify as Fair Use. If an AI model generates content substantially similar to an existing copyrighted work, it could be considered copyright infringement. However, arguments against the copyright infringement articulate that AI outputs are not direct copies but rather transformations of learned patterns, thus, potentially qualifying as Fair Use.

#### United States Copyright Office’s Policy on Copyright and AI Outputs

The US Copyright Office (USCO) has affirmed that the existing principles of copyright law are flexible enough to apply to AI, as they have applied well to technological innovations in the past, and changes to the existing law are not required to provide protections for AI generated output. USCO has concluded that the outputs that have resulted from generative AI can only be protected by copyright if there has been sufficient human contribution and creativity beyond just prompting the AI model. Situations where human authors could claim copyright protections for AI generated works include where the human has made a creative arrangement or modification to the output.

| _Elisa Shupe’s AI Machinations: Tangled Webs and Typed Words_ | Text         | In 2023, Elisa Shupe self published her novel AI Machinations: Tangled Webs and Typed Words which was co-written with the help of ChatGPT. When Shupe first submitted her work to be copyrighted, she was initially denied. However, Shupe appealed this copyright rejection by stating that she used ChatGPT as an assistive technology due to her cognitive disabilities. Moreover, Shupe stated she should be given Copyright protections since she had a creative selection, coordination, and arrangement in her book. USCO reversed their decision and gave Elisa Shupe a limited copyright registration for her creative selection, coordination, and arrangement in her book; however, the sentences and paragraphs themselves are not copyrighted.     |
| _AI Generated Song “Heart on My Sleeve”_                      | Music        | This case study can be looked upon as a combination of copyright infringement on both inputs and outputs. In 2023, a user AI-generated a song, “Heart on my Sleeve” using the vocals of artists Drake and the Weekend. The song went viral on both Spotify and TikTok and was even submitted for Grammy consideration. Within days, the song was taken down from various platforms in response to claims by the artists’ record label, Universal Music Group. Music in the style of someone else is not considered a derivative work for purposes of copyright law and is allowed; however, given that the AI model must have been trained on both Drake and The Weekend’s vocals, the outputs could be considered a derivative work and infringe on copyright. |

The office denied the copyright application under the established human-authorship requirement that has been affirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _Kris Kashtanova’s Zarya of the Dawn_                         | Images & Art | In September 2022, Zarya of the Dawn was granted copyright protection; however, in 2023, the copyright claim was revoked under the pretense that it had not met the human-authorship requirement for the images of the graphic novel since they were generated with Midjourney. The result of the copyright claim was that the arrangement of the images, text, and story of the book were protected under copyright, but the images themselves were not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Digital Millennium Copyright Act

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a US copyright law enacted in 1998 that seeks to remedy copyright issues online and in digital spaces. Projections include protecting copyright holders from online infringement and limiting the liability of online service providers for their users' actions. Under the DMCA, a rights-holder gives notice to a third party online platform that a work they are distributing is violating their copyright rights. Under the DMCA, platforms have to immediately take the work down. This is often referred to as a “DMCA Takedown,” and essentially places the burden of reporting AI output copyright infringement on artists and copyright owners. This law is essential in understanding how copyright online works and how it relates to artificial intelligence.

### Adjacent Topic: Unauthorized Uses of Likeness

Copyright and likeness under the right to publicity are commonly argued together in these conversations. Because AI enables the creation of synthetic videos, voices, and images that may infringe copyrights, when generating audio or visual content that is similar enough to an existing individual, it may not only violate copyright laws, but it may also violate publicity rights and one’s likeness. Some jurisdictions are considering legislation to address AI-generated media that mimics real individuals, such as NO FAKES (The Nurture Originals, Foster Art, and Keep Entertainment Safe) Act or the recently passed ELVIS Act (Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security) in Tennessee.

## Glossary

IP: Intellectual Property (IP) refers to legal rights that protect creations of the mind, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.

Copyright: Copyright is a subcategory of IP and is the legal right that grants creators exclusive control over the reproduction, distribution, and adaptation of their original creative works.

Authorship: Authorship refers to the person or entity that creates an original work and is entitled to copyright protection.

Copyrightable: A term used to describe a work that is original and sufficiently creative to be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.

Creativity: Creativity in copyright law requires a minimal degree of intellectual effort, ensuring that a work is sufficiently unique and not purely functional or factual.

Derivative work: A derivative work is a new creation that is based on or adapted from an existing copyrighted work, such as a remix, translation, or film adaptation.

Fair use: Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, and research.

Originality: Originality means that a work must be independently created by an author and contain some degree of creativity to qualify for copyright protection.
