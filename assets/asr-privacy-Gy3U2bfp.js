const e=`**Overview:**  
Voice AI devices like smart assistants use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to improve user experience. However, the constant listening required for activation commands raises privacy concerns, as unintended data collection can capture sensitive personal information such as age, gender, and emotional state. This data is susceptible to unauthorized access and misuse, including the potential for voice cloning.

**Challenges Include:**

- Unintended data capture through continuous listening
- Risks of unauthorized access and misuse (e.g., targeted advertising or fraudulent impersonation)
