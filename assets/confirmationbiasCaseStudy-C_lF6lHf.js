A high-contrast mode is introduced in a digital interface to improve accessibility for visually impaired users. Initial feedback from a small group of users is overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the belief that the solution effectively meets accessibility needs. However, this **confirmation bias** leads to the oversight of *edge cases*, such as individuals with light sensitivity or migraines, who may find high-contrast displays uncomfortable or even painful. As a result, the design, intended to be inclusive, ends up inadvertently excluding users with different visual needs. A more effective approach would involve testing with a diverse range of users, considering multiple accessibility preferences, and offering customizable contrast settings to accommodate varying sensitivities.
