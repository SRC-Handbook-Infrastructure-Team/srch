const e=`## Understanding AI Development Lifecycle

The AI development lifecycle provides a framework for understanding how bias is introduced to automated-decision making systems. 

### Understanding Data Generation Phase of AI Development

In this phase, data is generated and a dataset is created. Data can be generated naturalistically or through experiments. **A dataset is created by defining and sampling from a target population, measuring variables of interest, pre-processing the dataset, and defining a train/test split.** For example, in a weather prediction AI model, weather data is generated naturally and simply needs to be measured to be collected. Questions of which regions to include (e.g. US or global), what kind of weather variables to include (e.g. temperature or precipitation, continuous or categorical values), what preprocessing steps to take, and how to define the testing dataset are all decisions with trade-offs.

### Understanding Model Creation Phase of AI Development

**Once a dataset is created, a model must be defined, trained, evaluated, and deployed.** Defining an AI model involves determining the model architecture, loss function, optimizer, and hyperparameters. Next the model is trained, requiring decisions about how many epochs to train on. Once trained, the model is evaluated on metrics like accuracy, F1 accuracy, and/or accuracy across categories. Following this, model post-processing like thresholding can be implemented to transform outputs into a task-specific format. Once the model has been trained, evaluated, and post-processed, it is deployed for real-world use. It is useful to view the model creation process as iterative rather than linear. Once a model is deployed, it can be trained on real-time data or augmented to increase accuracy for under-performing categories[^1]. ChatGPT is an example of this; it improves its output by training on user data (input) and personalizing responses through its user memory feature which stores a summary of user data[^2].
