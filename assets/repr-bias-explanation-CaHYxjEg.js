const e=`1. **Inclusion Bias**: When the target population does not represent the use population, the model will learn traits that donâ€™t reflect the use population.   
2. **Sampling Bias**: When sampling methods are uneven or limited, the dataset will under-represent some demographics in the use population.  
3. **Underrepresentation Bias:** Underrepresented groups in the use population will be underrepresented in the target population. This bias can occur even if sampling methods are perfect and the target population accurately reflects the use population.

Regardless of the reason that a dataset fails to robustly represent the use population, AI models trained on under representative datasets will perform worse on underrepresented subjects.
