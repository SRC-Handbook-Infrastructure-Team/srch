const e=`One example of this is [forensic investigation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43741598?seq=3). By collecting some data of many people to begin with, when an investigation is needed, more people can be excluded based on the beginning data and will not have their privacy needlessly violated. If this doesnâ€™t occur, then more people will need to be investigated deeply, requiring a trade-off in who gets privacy, even if the average amount of privacy between individuals is the same.\r
