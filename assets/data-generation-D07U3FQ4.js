const e=`### Understanding Data Generation Phase of AI Development

In this phase, data is generated and a dataset is created. Data can be generated naturalistically or through experiments. A dataset is created by defining and sampling from a target population, measuring variables of interest, pre-processing the dataset, and defining a train/test split. For example, in a weather prediction AI model, weather data is generated naturally and simply needs to be measured to be collected. Questions of which regions to include (e.g. US or global), what kind of weather variables to include (e.g. temperature or precipitation, continuous or categorical values), what preprocessing steps to take, and how to define the testing dataset are all decisions with trade-offs.
