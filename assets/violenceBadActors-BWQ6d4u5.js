const e=`Generally, privacy may act as a shield against having action and identity be observed, preventing violence between people on this basis. This works well when using an access-based approach to privacy.\r

This is visible in a counterexample where someone loses privacy. “Swatting” is a technical instance of this, where the data of specific individuals are compromised and misused to place fraudulent calls about a serious, dangerous event where those compromised people are. These calls [often take advantage of modern phone technologies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10058781&tag=1) to protect the harasser’s own privacy. In doing this, the goal is to provoke a heavily armed, militant police response (typically with specialized hostage rescue and special weapons teams) to harass and attack the individual. This may happen to [public figures](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816030937/https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/08/15/keffals-adin-ross-ishowspeed-swatting-twitch-youtube/) and [non-public figures](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/staff-us-voting-machine-firms-prep-doxxing-misinformation-swatting-2024-11-01/).\r

Alternatively, a positive example is [Address Confidentiality Programs (ACPs)](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/dcujl6&i=217). ACPs obscure the home addresses of victims of domestic violence, stalking, and assault by providing them with a generic substitute address that can be used for mail forwarding and public records, preventing bad actors from accessing their location through these records. In turn, this prevents ongoing violence between individuals. `;export{e as default};
