const e=`Predictive algorithms used to approve high risk care management programs in healthcare screen 200 million people in the US each year. Algorithms produce risk scores to identify patients who will benefit most from these programs. However, healthcare spending was used as a proxy for health issues. Because Black patients spend less on healthcare due to socioeconomic and systemic barriers, Black patients at a given risk score are significantly sicker than White patients, with an average of 26.3% more chronic illnesses. As a result, measurement bias leads to higher need Black patients being denied access to high risk care management programs compared with lower need White patients with equivalent healthcare spending. In response, the healthcare company worked with researchers to develop a better proxy that combined health prediction with cost prediction, leading to an 84% reduction in bias[^1].
