const e=`Certain definitions of privacy focus on the separation of the [nav:public and private spheres](whatIsPrivacy), including how much control an individual has over those areas. This has implications both ways. Using public resources is a public action, which allows for enforcement of particular regulations against how that resource might be used, serving some wider public interest. At the same time, private control of a resource lets someone use that resource for their private interest, providing them agency. This works well when thinking about privacy as a conduit for control or that allows a private sphere of action.\r

An example of this in regulation is the third amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While there might be a prevailing public interest to require that soldiers are able to live in people’s homes, the private interest to have control over intimate and vulnerable spaces takes precedence. In essence, there is a [defined private space that’s separate from the public where someone cannot be coerced](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/valur26&i=271). Some readings of the third amendment [extend this idea to modern tech and surveillance](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/wflron4&i=7), especially as the government may enter homes digitally through consumer technology, enforcing a type of “quartering.”\r
