const e=`In private or semi-private settings, individuals may be better able to challenge norms and push back against a wider status quo without fear of social or political retribution. In doing so, broader social norms can be identified as restrictive standards that can be rejected and further improved. Grassroots changes in social norms and institutions may occur as a result. This works well when thinking about privacy as defining private spheres of place and action.\r

Anonymous forums serve as an example of this. YikYak, now Sidechat, is a version of these forums that targets college students and allows anonymous posting when a user is within the bounds of a college campus. [Users of the app describe the dual issue with anonymity](https://bruknow.library.brown.edu/discovery/openurl?institution=01BU_INST&vid=01BU_INST:BROWN&aulast=Tripodi&id=doi:10.2307%2Fj.ctt1t89cfr.22&auinit=F&atitle=Yakking%20about%20college%20life:%20Examining%20the%20role%20of%20anonymous%20forums%20on%20community%20identity%20formation&sid=google), noting that people on the app are more likely to express more nuanced and positive feelings than they would otherwise be willing to share because of the anonymity, but also that this same anonymity allows users to also be more hateful. Other research on different online spaces repeats this same tension on anonymity, showing these forums as places where [hateful ideologies can be developed](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315728346-21/none-new-media-alice-marwick), but also where [queer connection can flourish](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/hcrcl38&i=168) and [women may find safety from harassment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2675133.2675175).  \r
