const i=`# Papers Explaining the Impossibility of Fairness

##### Theory-focused
- *[The (Im)possibility of fairness: different value systems require different mechanisms for fair decision-making](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3433949)*: The impossibility of achieving all fairness criteria in one case; mechanisms must align with specific values
- *[FACT Diagnostic: How to Better Understand Trade-offs Involving Group Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03424)*: A framework to analyze trade-offs between fairness metrics

##### Case-study-focused
- *[Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Scores](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807)*: Proves automated risk score calculation cannot satisfy multiple fairness criteria at once
- *[Fair prediction with disparate impact](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00056)*: Shows enforcing fairness metrics often reduces accuracy
- *[Algorithmic decision making and the cost of fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08230)*: Quantifies efficiency losses when prioritizing fairness
