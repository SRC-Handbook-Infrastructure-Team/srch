Although the intention is to cater to every possible preference, the overwhelming number of choices can create **choice overload**, especially for users with *cognitive or attention challenges* who find it difficult to sift through all the options. For individuals with *visual impairments*, navigating through the dense array of categories and subcategories can be a time-consuming process. A more **accessible design** would simplify the decision-making process by offering clear categories, reducing unnecessary options, and providing guided assistance to help users focus on what matters most to them.";export{e as default};
