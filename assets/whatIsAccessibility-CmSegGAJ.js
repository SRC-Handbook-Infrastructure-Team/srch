# What is Accessibility?

Entire populations are affected by the computational choices made in technology design. When thinking about how to incorporate accessibility into computer science pedagogy, it is crucial to understand that accessibility cannot exist under a single definition. For the purpose of this primer, accessibility will be framed through three categories.

1. Universality
2. Disability
3. Equity

Accessibility is often regarded as a priority that is superseded by functionality and efficiency. But accessibility is inseparable from the systems we are familiar with [drawer:we are familiar with](case-study-1-accessibility-1), and is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives.

Technological accessibility is necessary in the creation of well-designed systems. How a system can be accessible will vary, but for its use in this primer, we will define something as accessible when **it takes into account the needs of its users, and then is designed with the intention of minimizing the barriers associated with those needs.**

## Accessibility through Universality

Universal design is a utilitarian approach to technological accessibility. While there exists contestation as to the exact definition of universal design, most definitions converge on the idea that it necessitates the design of an environment, be that digital or physical, constructed in a manner that makes it usable for all (or at the least most) people.[^2] [drawer:In practice](case-study-2-accessibility-1) this looks like systems that require little to no adaptation from the user because the design took into account, and catered itself to, the similarities between most people.

Because universal design often considers the most people that can be included in a design, it runs the risk of not addressing people with needs at the margins.

## Accessibility through Disability

There exist four main categories of disability: visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive. Individuals with disability may experience disability permanently, temporarily, and situationally.[^3] In the context of disability, accessibility can mean taking an explicit look at the needs of those with disability and designing in collaboration with those [drawer:perspectives](case-study-3-accessibility-1).

## Accessibility through Equity

Technological equity can be understood as the narrowed application of social equity. The Internet Society Foundation defines digital equity as "the state where every person and community has the necessary information technology resources to participate in society, democracy, and the economy fully."[^5] The barriers that keep people from equitable access to technology follow patterns of social disparity, meaning that factors such as income, gender, and race often correlate with digital inequity.

Disparities in digital access (referred to as the "digital divide") exacerbate disparate outcomes between marginalized and privileged groups in a tech-centered world.[^6] Digital equity is accessibility because it centers how different groups are able to access technology, and thus [drawer:can be addressed](case-study-4-accessibility-1) in product design, computation, policy, and beyond.

## A Dynamic Approach to Accessibility

These definitions of accessibility are just three conceptions amid an entire field of scholarship. What makes digital accessibility exciting to think about is the way it is constantly changing and redefining itself given the context in which it is being evaluated. By using the framework of Universality, Disability, and Equity, we hope to clarify that there are facets to accessibility that one _must_ consider when interacting with, designing, and creating in the technological space.
