const e=`**Case:** In his oft-cited concurrence to [*Katz v. United States*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/35) (1967), Justice Harlan writes that a telephone booth is a private setting, more similar to one’s home, where one has a reasonable expectation of privacy, than to a field, where one does not have such an expectation. The delineation of public and private spheres in Katz is in relation to the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.

**Case:** In [*Griswold v. Connecticut*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1964/496) (1965), the Court found that a right to marital privacy inferred from the guarantees of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments prevented the state from making contraceptive use illegal for married couples. This legal conception of privacy has been continually challenged. In a dissent to the original case, Justice Potter Stewart wrote, “I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court” (530). More recently, Justice Clarence Thomas rejected the argument behind Griswold in his concurrence to [*Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392) (2022),  which eliminated the constitutional right to abortion.`;export{e as default};
