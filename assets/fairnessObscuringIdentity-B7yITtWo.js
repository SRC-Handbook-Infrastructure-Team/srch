const i=`An obscured aspect of one’s identity is no longer available to others to support segregation or discrimination along those lines. Individuals *must* be treated equally on the basis of that characteristic, as no information is made available – there is a veil of ignorance.

Sexual relationships may be viewed as something that should be private to someone and their partner, which calls into question who should have access to knowledge about these relationships and when. As it’s possible to [infer sexuality from digital behavior](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1218772110) and [sexual minorities report discrimination due to disclosure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819984/) in private spheres, being able to obfuscate identity becomes a pressing issue. \r

Another instance may be “Ban the Box” movements, pushing employers to not include questions about prior criminal history on job applications. By not asking about this background, those with criminal histories experience [less discrimination in hiring and are more likely to find employment](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/ilr104&i=1107). At the same time, privacy in this area has spillover trade-offs, with some research suggesting that it [decreases hiring rates overall for other demographics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/705880) that already experience discrimination in hiring.`;export{i as default};
