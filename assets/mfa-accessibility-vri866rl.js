const i=`**Overview:**  
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) greatly enhances security by requiring multiple steps for identity verification. Yet, various MFA methods can exclude users with disabilities. For instance, time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) may be challenging for those with cognitive impairments, and audio or visual methods might not be accessible to all. In some cases, users disable MFA to overcome these barriers, potentially lowering their overall security.

**Challenges Include:**

- Difficulties for users with cognitive, visual, or auditory impairments
- Security risks when users opt to disable MFA due to accessibility challenges
