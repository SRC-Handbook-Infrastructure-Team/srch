const e="A designer implements a high-contrast mode in a new app to improve accessibility for *visually impaired users*. After gathering feedback from a small group of users who respond positively, the designer assumes the solution effectively meets the needs of all individuals with visual impairments. However, this assumption reflects **confirmation bias**, as it overlooks users with different accessibility needsâ€“ such as those with light sensitivity, who may find high-contrast modes uncomfortable or even painful. By failing to consider a diverse range of user experiences, the designer unintentionally creates an *exclusionary design* that benefits some but alienates others. A more inclusive approach would involve engaging a wider range of users, incorporating *iterative testing*, and offering *customizable contrast settings* to accommodate varying accessibility needs.";export{e as default};
