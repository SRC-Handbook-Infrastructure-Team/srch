const e=`When AI models are distilled to be more compact, they lose the nuance necessary to capture under-represented features in the data. For example, **in AI-based breast cancer screening**, **rare cancers are under-represented in medical images.** If a breast cancer detection model is distilled, performance disparities for under-represented cancers will increase because the distilled model has fewer parameters with which it can learn complex underrepresented features in the data.[^1]
