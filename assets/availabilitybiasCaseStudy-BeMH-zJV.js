const e="A ticket booking website features an *interactive visual seat selection tool*, designed under the assumption that clicking on a seating chart is the most intuitive way to choose a seat. However, this approach overlooks users who rely on *screen readers* or *keyboard navigation*, making the process inaccessible. Because the design is shaped by what seems familiar and efficient to sighted users, it fails to account for diverse interaction needs. Without alternative methods, such as a structured list view with text-based seat descriptions, users with visual or motor impairments may struggle to complete their booking. A more inclusive design would provide multiple ways to select seats, ensuring accessibility through keyboard-friendly navigation, ARIA labels, and text-based alternatives.";export{e as default};
