# Design Processeses\r
\r
When designing any product, processes may be followed to iterate from ideation to implementation and incorporate user feedback. Thoughtful design processes that include deep considerations of users can support **usability** and [nav:accessibility](accessibility/whatIsAccessibility) for diverse target markets.\r
\r
## Design Goals: Defining a User Market\r
\r
Users individually define their unique system requirements, and designers are tasked with accommodating those needs. Among many diverse users, designers must reason about which users, if not all of them, that they intend to target. Deciding on a target market can guide later design decisions, such as user demographics to include in participatory design practices.\r
\r
Although often used interchangeably, inclusive and universal design are distinct design philosophies. **Universal design** refers to the practice of making mainstream products accessible to as many people as technically possible. **Inclusive design** refers to the practice of designing to satisfy the needs of a target market, based on identifiers such as age, ability, and language, then extending to other users. The [drawer: “curb cut” effect](sidePanel1) describes how design intended to support disabled users can benefit a larger group of people than they were designed for. Neither approach is a guarantee that the resulting product is universally accessible or usable, although defining goals at the beginning of design processes may aid in scoping designs to a target market. Other design goals may be defined based on the purpose of the specific product, including the [Universal Design Principles](https://dac.berkeley.edu/services/campus-building-accessibility/universal-design-principles). For example, simple and intuitive use targets limiting complexity to ease usability and accessibility for diverse users. **Hick’s Law** states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the complexity of choices. Cognitive factors such as this enforce the priority to design simple systems when it is possible. Design should clearly communicate how an object is meant to be used. **Affordances** define what actions are possible, while **signifiers** indicate how to perform those actions. Accessible design prioritizes strong signifiers, such as tactile markers, audible cues, and high-contrast visuals, to ensure usability for diverse users.\r
\r
The relationship between controls and their effects should be intuitive. Poorly designed **mapping** forces users to guess how an interface works, increasing cognitive strain and the likelihood of errors. Immediate and meaningful **feedback** ensures that actions produce expected results, reinforcing understanding and reducing uncertainty.\r
\r
## Design Processes\r
\r
![This is a flow chart showing the progression of design processes with increasing user consideration. From least to most user consideration, the design processes are "Abiding by Legal Requirements," "Following Standards and Best Practices," "Creating User Personas and Stories Based on Research," and "Engaging Users in Participatory Design Practices."](/srch-s25/public/assets/primer-photos/flow.png)\r
To carry out the aforementioned design goals, specific design processes may be engaged with varying degrees of consideration for accessibility and usability. At a minimum, products must abide by legal requirements. In the US context, these may be requirements set by the [nav:Button Americans with Disabilities Act](accStandards). Beyond legality, designers may abide by standards or best practices in their domains. For example, web accessibility standards are defined by the [nav:Button Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](accStandards).\r
\r
While following legal requirements and best practices is important, intentionally including target users in design processes has many benefits. Deep consideration of user needs can produce better-designed products and lead to greater buy-in from target markets.\r
\r
### Design Thinking\r
\r
One approach to including users in **design processes** is design thinking. This user-centered approach centers the goals of **desirability,** **feasibility,** and **viability.** While there are various approaches, iteration is a key feature of design thinking, often visualized as the “double diamond.” Design thinking prioritizes building **user empathy** while defining the problem space that a product seeks to address. This may be accomplished through interacting with users directly or crafting personas and user stories to depict target users and how they might interact with the challenge the product is attempting to solve.\r
\r
### Participatory Design\r
\r
_“When creating products I recommend you always ask: Who else? Who else should be involved? Whose voice needs to be a part of the process?”_ - Annie Jean-Baptiste\r
**Participatory design** practices engage users throughout the design process by placing them in power over when and how products are created for them. A key component of this practice is the continued involvement of stakeholders - users are not only consulted for feedback on a completed product, but are included throughout the design process, from ideation to implementation. This strategy may be particularly effective in highly speculative design processes where involvement can enhance understanding of the target market’s needs and encourage early buy-in and acceptance. Some specific practices include:\r
\r
- **Co-Design**: A participatory approach to designing solutions in which community members are treated as equal collaborators in the design process. Involve users in the design process to reduce biases.\r
- **Parallel Low Fidelity Prototyping**: A design process where multiple basic (low-fidelity) prototypes are created simultaneously, allowing designers to explore a wide range of design ideas concurrently before settling on a single direction. Typically using quick and simple methods like paper sketches on basic wireframes to rapidly test and iterate on different concepts.\r
