const e=`## Case Study: Unified Payments Interface[^7] [^8]

In 2016, the National Payments Corporation of India established the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a single page mobile application that facilitates payment between parties in an efficient, accessible manner. UPI is managed by the Reserve Bank of India and partners with a variety of banks to allow users to access the service. UPI has been credited for including marginalized parties in a digital landscape with its ease and convenience of use, bolstering the Indian economy and reducing the cash-digital divide.
