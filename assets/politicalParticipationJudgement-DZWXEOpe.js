const e=`Privacy can hide the actions someone takes, either completely or only to certain people or groups. As a result, the perceived ethical impact of those actions are also made unavailable. This allows individuals to take actions without broader judgment from others, facilitating individualized decision-making that is free from social pressure. This hiding is often seen as a prerequisite to allowing free and equal decision-making by individuals that supports liberal democracy. This works well when thinking about privacy as something that delineates certain private spheres of action.\r

An example in modern practice is a voting booth. Even as party affiliation and the act of voting may be public information, how someone votes remains secret in most cases. Along a practical dimension, secret ballots prevent voter intimidation, coercion, and buying, allowing a vote to be actually reflective of the individual voterâ€™s interests [rather than of someone who may exercise power over them](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/729169/pdf). Ballot secrecy also supports the egalitarian view that anyone in a democratic society should be able to elect a [government without particular qualification](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/85A2E2D6D191AADA21D84BDB56E5F903/S0953820807002634a.pdf/mill_and_the_secret_ballot_beyond_coercion_and_corruption.pdf). This allows elections to be both [free (in that they are not coercive, including violently so) and fair](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16828) (in that treatment of people does not differ based on their vote). This is complicated when people may break privacy in the voting booth, [either via tampering with electronic voting machines](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301313) or by taking [ballot selfies](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/jlawp26&i=355).`;export{e as default};
