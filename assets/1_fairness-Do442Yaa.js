const e=`# Fairness & Justice\r
\r
When machines replace humans in making decisions with such great impact, it is important for their outcomes to remain fair and just. But what is algorithmic fairness and justice?\r
\r
## Procedural Equality vs. Equity\r
\r
One common criteria for fairness within the technical community is procedural equality.\r
\r
**Procedural Equality**: Everyone is subject to the same decision-making process. [drawer:See Example](procedural-equality-example)\r
\r
For example, ATS, or applicant tracking systems, are automated decision-making systems that employers use to screen resumes for hiring. Procedural equality is achieved when the system runs every application in the same way.\r
\r
## Types of Fairness\r
\r
There are several types of fairness measures:\r
\r
- **Individual Fairness**: [drawer:See Definition](individual-fairness) Similar individuals receive similar outcomes\r
- **Group Fairness**: [drawer:See Definition](group-fairness) Groups receive equitable treatment\r
