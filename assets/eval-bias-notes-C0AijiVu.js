const t=`Benefits:

* Benchmark datasets have advanced AI research by creating standardized evaluation datasets and encouraging innovation through competition. 

Risks:

* Because benchmark datasets often donâ€™t reflect the populations or situations they are used in, these datasets can create inflated accuracy that masks deficiencies in real world settings. 

Takeaways: 

* It is essential that benchmark datasets are used in-context, understanding limitations between the dataset and use population.   
* Without testing datasets that accurately reflect the use population and context, it is impossible to know the extent of algorithmic discrimination or which populations are affected. `;export{t as default};
