const e=`AI-based reading assistants have been developed to aid reading comprehension by using eye-tracking to provide definitions when readers struggle to comprehend words.[^1] Research shows that people with dyslexia have different eye movements when reading than people who don’t have dyslexia.[^2] If a reading assistant uses an underlying eye-tracking model that processes dyslexic and non-dyslexic eye-movement reading patterns in aggregate, it may fail to represent the distinct reading patterns of either subgroup accurately. In addition to aggregation bias, representation bias can further exacerbate performance disparities. Since people with dyslexia make up 20% of the population, if dyslexic reading patterns are not oversampled to account for underrepresentation in the use population, the model will also suffer from representation bias, leading to even higher error rates for people with dyslexia.[^3]
