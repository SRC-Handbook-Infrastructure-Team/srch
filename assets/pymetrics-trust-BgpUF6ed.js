const e=`## Case Study: Pymetrics Independent Audit\r
\r
Pymetrics develops algorithms that assess job candidates based on their performance in gamified assessments designed to measure cognitive and emotional traits. Aware of potential concerns about bias in hiring algorithms, pymetrics voluntarily submitted its candidate screening tools to an independent audit by researchers from Northeastern University.\r
\r
This cooperative audit was structured to maintain both rigor and independence. The auditors examined source code, tested statistical outcomes, and evaluated safeguards against manipulation. They specifically assessed whether pymetrics' implementation of the "four-fifths rule", a legal standard for detecting adverse impact in hiring, functioned as claimed. The audit confirmed that pymetrics' fairness guarantees were technically sound and included sufficient safeguards against both human error and intentional subversion.\r
\r
This approach established trustworthiness through multiple mechanisms: independent verification by credible third parties, transparency about methods, and a demonstrated willingness to subject proprietary systems to external scrutiny. By providing evidence that its fairness claims were more than marketing rhetoric, pymetrics established itself as a trustworthy actor in the sensitive context of employment.\r
